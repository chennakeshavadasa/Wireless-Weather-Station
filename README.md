# Wireless-Weather-Station
This repository contains the code and schematics for a wireless weather station built using Arduino, NodeMCU, DHT11, BMP180, and a water drop sensor. The station measures temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, and detects raindrops. Data is transmitted wirelessly to a server for real-time monitoring.
